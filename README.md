text classification with Naive Bayes

Overview:
A brief introduction to text classification and the use of the Naive Bayes algorithm.
Mention its simplicity and effectiveness for text classification tasks.


Dataset:
Description of the dataset used, including:
Number of classes/categories.
Size of the dataset (number of samples).
Any specifics about the data (e.g., language, domain).


Preprocessing:
Steps involved in preprocessing the text data:
Tokenization: Breaking text into tokens (words, n-grams).
Stopwords removal: Removing common words that don't contribute to classification.
Lemmatization or stemming: Normalizing words to their base form.
Vectorization: Converting text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.


Naive Bayes Algorithm:
Explanation of the Naive Bayes algorithm used:
Types (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes for text classification).
Assumptions and independence of features.


Model Building:
Details on how the model was trained:
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the Naive Bayes classifier on the preprocessed data.
Any parameter tuning or cross-validation techniques applied.


Evaluation:
Metrics used to evaluate the model's performance:
Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Confusion matrix to visualize performance across classes
